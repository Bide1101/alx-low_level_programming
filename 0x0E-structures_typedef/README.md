Structure & Typedef Project
This project demonstrates the use of structures and typedef in C programming language.

In C programming language, a structure is a user-defined data type that groups related data of different data types together. Typedef, on the other hand, allows the programmer to create aliases for existing data types, making it easier to define complex data structures.
