C - Preprocessor Task
This program demonstrates the use of C preprocessor directives to define and manipulate macros.
The program defines macros using the #define directive.
The program also demonstrates the use of conditional compilation using the #ifndef and #endif directives. This allows certain parts of the code to be included or excluded based on whether or not a particular macro is defined.
