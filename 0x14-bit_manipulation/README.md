Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation is the act of manipulating individual bits in a sequence of bits or binary digits, typically represented as a sequence of 0's and 1's. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as optimizing code, implementing encryption algorithms, and performing low-level operations on hardware.

Basic Operations

Bitwise AND (&)
The bitwise AND operation compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number where each bit is set to 1 only if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1.

Bitwise OR (|)
The bitwise OR operation compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number where each bit is set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the operands are 1.

Bitwise XOR (^)
The bitwise XOR operation compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number where each bit is set to 1 only if one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.

Bitwise Left Shift (<<)
The bitwise left shift operation shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the shifted bits with 0's.

Bitwise Right Shift (>>)
The bitwise right shift operation shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the shifted bits with 0's or 1's depending on the sign of the original number.

Bitwise NOT (~)
The bitwise NOT operation inverts all the bits of a number.
