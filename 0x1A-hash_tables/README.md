Hash Tables
Description
A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data. It provides constant-time complexity for these operations on average, making it a popular choice for implementing dictionaries, symbol tables, and caches.

The hash table uses a technique called hashing to map keys to indices in an underlying array. By applying a hash function to the key, the hash table determines the index where the corresponding value is stored. This enables fast access to data by directly calculating the storage location based on the key.

Features
Fast Retrieval: Hash tables offer constant-time complexity for searching, insertion, and deletion operations in the average case.
Flexible Key-Value Structure: They allow storing arbitrary key-value pairs, making them suitable for various applications.
Dynamic Size: Hash tables can dynamically resize themselves to accommodate a changing number of elements, ensuring efficient memory usage.
Collision Handling: Hash functions can produce the same index for different keys, resulting in collisions. Hash tables employ collision resolution techniques, such as separate chaining or open addressing, to handle collisions and maintain data integrity.
Wide Range of Applications: Hash tables are widely used for tasks like caching, symbol tables in compilers, database indexing, and implementing associative arrays.
Usage
To use a hash table in your project, follow these steps:

Include the hash table implementation in your codebase or import it from a library.
Create a new instance of a hash table, specifying the desired capacity or allowing it to use a default capacity.
Insert key-value pairs into the hash table using the insert or put operation. The hash table will calculate the appropriate index based on the key and store the value there.
Retrieve values by providing the corresponding key to the get operation. The hash table will return the value associated with the key if it exists.
Optionally, remove key-value pairs using the remove operation.
Perform any other necessary operations on the hash table, such as checking its size or iterating over its contents.


Implementation Details
Hash functions: Hash tables utilize hash functions to convert keys into array indices. The quality of the hash function affects the distribution of keys across the array, which in turn affects the efficiency of operations and collision rates.
Collision Resolution: In case of hash collisions, where two different keys map to the same index, hash tables employ collision resolution techniques to handle these conflicts. Common methods include separate chaining (using linked lists or other data structures) or open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, etc.).
Load Factor: Hash tables typically have a load factor, which represents the ratio of stored elements to the size of the underlying array. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hash table may resize itself to maintain efficiency.
Complexity Analysis
The average time complexity of hash table operations (lookup, insert, delete) is O(1) when the hash function provides a good distribution and the load factor is kept low. However, in the worst case scenario, these operations can take O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the hash table.
